# YouTube-API
A Python script that archives all of the user's playlists.

In order to use this script, you need to create a project in Google cloud console and create OAuth 2.0 client credentials in it. Put the resulting json file in the current directory as `credentials.json`, then when you run the script it will open the link and prompt you to authorize access to your data.
